Written Report

  I apologize I'm still getting the hang of this. I'll start by just summarizing what I went through step by step. The dataset provided was data from 15 schools and nearly 40,000 students. Not sure if it is fair to compare the two but it does seems like students get higher on average scores in reading versus math. 
  Of the 15 schools, they were split about down the middle between district and charter schools. Despite being an almost even number of the two kinds of schools, the trend seems to be more children in the district schools rather than the charter schools, though with this dataset I can't come to a meaningful conclusion as to why. 
  However, this does highlight a general trend that I was picking up looking at the data which is the reading and the math scores seem to be higher in general for the charter schools rather than the district schools. In combination with the smaller number of students, one wonders if there is better student to teacher ratios or something of that matter. 
  There does seem to be a correlation with the size of the school and the test scores, on average the bigger the school and the more students the lower the average reading and math scores. However, and it could be because my math didn't come out right on some of the data frames, it seemed like per capita spending on students did not meaningfully increase their reading and math scores, which I find interesting and worth looking into (both my coding, and looking for more data).
